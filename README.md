# Web-servers

### What are they?

whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. 
When the request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) HTTP server accepts the request, 
finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP.
